What is UDT?

  A UDT is Defined as Any Technology Developed Outside the Governance & Oversight of IT 

  Any specific use of a software (e.g. M S Excel/ MS Access) that resides on shared drive, workstations and not supported by Corporate Technology Group is defined as User Defined Technology (UDT). Most of the cases, these are MS Excel or Access documents prepared by business users.


The UDT Risk Rating Application Tool also known as the IRM Tool has to be updated with the UDT Information.
This is an internal portal that has been designed and managed by the Internal Apps Team (Pershing).
It contains a pre – defined questionnaire that has to be filled in by the user upon including the Inventory Information.
This is one of the mandatory “Baseline Controls” – Inventory and Data Classification that has to be adhered by every UDT Owner.
The Risk Rating Application automatically calculates a SCORE of the respective UDT based on the answers chosen by the user 
for the specific UDT.
